abstract = {We propose a polarization dependent loss (PDL) and chromatic dispersion (CD) insensitive, low-complexity adaptive equalizer (AEQ) for short-reach coherent optical transmission systems. The AEQ contains a 1-tap butterfly finite impulse response (FIR) filter and two N-tap FIR filters. It first performs polarization demultiplexing using the 1-tap filter, of which the coefficients are obtained based on Stokes space. Then it mitigates the inter-symbol interference (ISI) using the two N-tap finite impulse response (FIR) filters and adjust the filter's coefficients by utilizing constant modulus algorithm (CMA). Through theoretical and experimental analysis, we verify that this proposed AEQ can perform robust polarization demultiplexing when PDL and CD exists. Besides, our proposed AEQ has faster convergence speed compared with recently proposed AEQs. In addition, it reduces the number of multipliers and thus reduce the computational complexity of conventional butterfly filter structure AEQ. And this proposed AEQ suffers little bit error ratio loss compared with the conventional AEQ. Due to the low-complexity and robustness to PDL and CD, this proposed AEQ is well-suited for future low-cost short-reach optical communication system.},
